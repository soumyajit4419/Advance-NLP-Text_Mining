## TEXT-SUMMARIZATION [Abstractive Approach]

## Project Description
* The abstraction technique entails paraphrasing and shortening parts of the source document. When abstraction is applied for text summarization in deep learning problems, it can overcome the grammar inconsistencies of the extractive method.
* The abstractive text summarization algorithms create new phrases and sentences that relay the most useful information from the original text like humans do.

### Abstractive Text Summarization using Transfer Learning of pretained trasformer models

#### 

#### I have used two methods for Summarization of text:
* Using Pretrained BART which uses Pytorch 
* Uisng Pretrained T5 which uses Tensorflow

### These are pertained transformers and are trained on large dataset ex:CNN Daily Mail and many more.

### Methods Used
* Deep Learning Learning
* NLP
* Transformer
* BART
* T5


### Technologies 
* Python

### Usage
