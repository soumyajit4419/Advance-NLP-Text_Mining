## Project Description

### Extraction Based Summarization:- 

#### The extractive text summarization technique involves pulling keyphrases from the source document and combining them to make a summary. The extraction is made according to the defined metric without making any changes to the texts.

####  Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an example of topic model and is used to classify text in a document to a particular topic

#### I have used the 20newsgroup dataset that is available from sklearn. This dataset has news articles grouped into 20 news categories.Traing it with LDA and predicting topics from some new news.
