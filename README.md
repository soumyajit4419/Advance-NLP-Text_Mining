## Natural Language Processing - Text Mining
-----

This repository is a collection of different  Deep Learning projects using various library available in Keras ans Tensorflow and build some intresting models using Deep Learning.

Repository to track the progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including the datasets and the current state-of-the-art for the most common NLP tasks

I hope that you would enjoy while checking out those repositories related to ML,And Deep Learning on the table below.
