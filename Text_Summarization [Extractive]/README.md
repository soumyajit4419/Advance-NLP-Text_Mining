## Project Description

### Extraction Based Summarization:- 

#### The extractive text summarization technique involves pulling keyphrases from the source document and combining them to make a summary. The extraction is made according to the defined metric without making any changes to the texts. Although sometimes the summary can be grammatically strange.

#### I have used two methods for Summarization of text:
* TFIDF Method : Generating Summary based on 'tfidf' score.
* Text Rank Method: Genearting Summary based on 'text rank algorithm' similar to google page rank.

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* NLP
* Tfidf Vectorizer
* TextRank 


### Technologies 
* Python
